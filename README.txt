With WimTVPro you can extend WordPress with a powerful plugin that allows you to organize, store, publish and stream video in posts, pages or widgets to any location within your website/blog.

- set a price for the visualisation of your video content. Just connect your Web TV to your PayPal account
- given a list of videos, publish those of choice on your website
- insert videos anywhere on the page (e.g. in posts, pages or widgets)
- choose the skin and the size of the video player
- set your privacy to make videos available to everyone or only to certain users
- create a new video playlist and insert into the pages and posts of the site
- create live streaming events to be published on the pages of your site
