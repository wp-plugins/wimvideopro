WimTVPro is the video plugin that adds several features to manage and publish video on demand, video playlists and stream live events on your website.

== Description ==

With WimTVPro you can extend WordPress with a powerful plugin that allows you to organize, store, publish and stream video in posts, pages or widgets to any location within your website/blog.

Storage and bandwidth used for the video is provided by WimTV, the innovative platform for live and on demand video streaming. To use the plugin, you must have a Web TV account on WimTV. Registration is free of charge. You can easily sign up directly from the plugin. 

WimTVPro allows its users to:

*  upload new videos, describe and publish
*  for each video published, set of access conditions (free, creative commons, pay per view)
*  set a price for the visualisation of your video content. Just connect your Web TV to your PayPal account
*  given a list of videos, publish those of choice on your website
*  insert videos anywhere on the page (e.g. in posts, pages or widgets)
*  choose the skin and the size of the video player
*  set your privacy to make videos available to everyone or only to certain users
*  create a new video playlist and insert into the pages and posts of the site
*  create live streaming events to be published on the pages of your site
*  recording video of live events that have been already broadcasted
*  change with drag-and-drop the order of presentation of videos on a web page
*  control and monitor access analytics for your content
*  embed your live and on demand videos on any site
*  synchronize videos with your WimTV account 
*  create a video channel on WimTV, becoming part of the community

The plugin is integrated into the menu and is divided in section, to always have an ordered control of content.
